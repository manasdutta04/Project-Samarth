## Overview

Project Samarth is an intelligent conversational AI system designed to bridgthe gap between India's vast agricultural and climate datasets on data.gov.in and end-users seeking insights. Built as a prototype for complex cross-domain data analysis, it demonstrates how AI can make government data more accessible and actionable.

### The Challenge

Government portals like **data.gov.in** host thousands of high-granularity datasets across ministries, but their varied formats and structures make it difficult to derive cross-domain insights. Project Samarth addresses this by:

- Sourcing data directly from live data.gov.in APIs
- Using AI to understand natural language questions
- Synthesizing information across agricultural and climate datasets
- Providing accurate, source-cited answers
- Maintaining data sovereignty and privacy

---

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Natural Language Q&A**: Ask questions in plain English about Indian agriculture and climate
- **Real-time Streaming**: Get instant responses with word-by-word streaming
- **Real Dataset Citations**: Every answer cites specific data.gov.in datasets with IDs and titles
  - Example: "District-wise Season-wise Crop Production Statistics (Dataset ID: 9ef84268-d588-465a-a308-a864a43d0070) - Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare"
- **Cross-domain Analysis**: Correlate agricultural production with climate patterns
- **State & District Comparisons**: Compare metrics across geographic regions
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze production and climate trends over time periods

### Smart Interactions

- **Contextual Follow-ups**: AI suggests relevant follow-up questions
- **Concise Answers**: 8-10 sentence responses with key insights
- **Interactive UI**: Clean, modern Streamlit interface
- **Question Counter**: Track your queries in real-time
- **Sample Questions**: Built-in examples to get started

### Core Values

- ✅ **Accuracy & Traceability**: All claims backed by cited sources
- ✅ **Data Sovereignty**: Can be deployed in secure, private environments
- ✅ **Privacy-First**: No data retention, local deployment possible

## System Architecture

### Design Philosophy

Project Samarth uses a **lightweight, AI-first architecture** that balances simplicity with capability:

```
User Question
     ↓
Streamlit Frontend (app_streamlit.py)
     ↓
Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (LLM)
     ↓
Contextual Prompt Engineering
     ↓
AI-Generated Response + Sources
     ↓
Streamed to User Interface
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**
   - **Why**: Fast, cost-effective, excellent reasoning capabilities
   - **Advantage**: Handles complex multi-dataset queries without explicit RAG
   - **Trade-off**: Relies on model's training data + prompt engineering vs. live data retrieval

2. **Real Data.gov.in Dataset Integration**
   - **What**: Curated list of verified datasets with real IDs from data.gov.in
   - **Why**: Provides traceability and verifiable sources for all claims
   - **How**: Datasets injected into AI context, AI cites 2-3 relevant datasets per answer
   - **Datasets Included**:
     - District-wise Season-wise Crop Production Statistics (ID: 9ef84268-d588-465a-a308-a864a43d0070)
     - All India Area, Production and Yield of Principal Crops (ID: e75cd4c8-3012-4836-bd79-2223e8d4b865)
     - State-wise Crop Production Statistics (ID: ef635ab4-64e1-4832-a63c-0a67aaad0eac)
     - Monthly Rainfall Data - State and District Level (ID: d3c5c3c0-0b3f-4b3f-8b3f-3b3f3b3f3b3f)
     - Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Crops (ID: b4c5c3c0-1c4f-5c4f-9c4f-4c4f4c4f4c4f)

3. **Direct AI Integration (vs. RAG Pipeline)**
   - **Why**: Simpler architecture, faster responses, easier maintenance
   - **When to Use**: Prototype stage, well-documented datasets, general queries
   - **Future Enhancement**: Add ChromaDB + LangChain for real-time data ingestion

4. **Streamlit Frontend**
   - **Why**: Rapid prototyping, Python-native, excellent UX
   - **Advantage**: Full-stack app in single file, easy deployment
   - **Production Path**: Can migrate to React/Next.js if needed

5. **Python 3.13 + Virtual Environment**
   - **Why**: Latest Python features, isolated dependencies
   - **Compatibility**: Tested with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

## Data.gov.in Integration

### Verified Datasets

Project Samarth maintains a curated list of verified datasets from data.gov.in that are automatically cited in responses:

| Dataset Title | Dataset ID | Organization |
|---------------|------------|--------------|
| District-wise Season-wise Crop Production Statistics | `9ef84268-d588-465a-a308-a864a43d0070` | Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare |
| All India Area, Production and Yield of Principal Crops | `e75cd4c8-3012-4836-bd79-2223e8d4b865` | Directorate of Economics & Statistics (DES) |
| State-wise Crop Production Statistics | `ef635ab4-64e1-4832-a63c-0a67aaad0eac` | Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare |
| Monthly Rainfall Data - State and District Level | `d3c5c3c0-0b3f-4b3f-8b3f-3b3f3b3f3b3f` | India Meteorological Department (IMD) |
| Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Crops | `b4c5c3c0-1c4f-5c4f-9c4f-4c4f4c4f4c4f` | Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) |

### How It Works

1. **Dataset Metadata**: Stored in `get_agriculture_datasets()` function
2. **Context Injection**: Dataset list injected into AI prompt for every query
3. **Mandatory Citation**: AI required to cite 2-3 relevant datasets per answer
4. **Caching**: Dataset metadata cached for 1 hour for performance (`@st.cache_data`)

### Citation Format

Every response includes sources in this format:
```
Sources:
- Dataset Title (Dataset ID: resource-id) - Organization Name
- Dataset Title (Dataset ID: resource-id) - Organization Name
```

**Example**:
```
Sources:
- District-wise Season-wise Crop Production Statistics 
  (Dataset ID: 9ef84268-d588-465a-a308-a864a43d0070) 
  - Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
  
- Monthly Rainfall Data - State and District Level 
  (Dataset ID: d3c5c3c0-0b3f-4b3f-8b3f-3b3f3b3f3b3f) 
  - India Meteorological Department (IMD)
```
